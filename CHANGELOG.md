# Changelog

## 1.2.0 — Compact redesign

- Separate application launcher at `/`, with Airspace Analytics pinned as the first link. No duplicated statistics, large hero, or promotional copy.
- Analytics workspace available at `/analytics` on the **same port**, retaining the existing Aerodrome read-only data APIs.
- Reduced analytics navigation to Traffic, Patterns, Compare, Aircraft, Database and Settings.
- Simplified Traffic view: single primary graph, metric toggle, quick date choices, automatic grouping, click-to-drill, Zoom out/Reset, and line/bar modes.
- Moved aviation breakdowns, deeper filters, explanations and saved views into collapsible sections.
- Launcher links now support Add, Remove, Move up/down, Reset defaults and editable full URLs/ports; the pinned Analytics link cannot be accidentally deleted.
- Retained the existing in-app authenticated GitHub updater and prior `sessionStorage` update token.
- Mobile interface and typography redesigned for density and clarity.
